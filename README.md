<p>
This resume was built with the gatsby starter blog + personal portfolio. It was built as an excuse to try out Gatsby. Currently it is just my resume. Obviously this does not need to be React/ Gatsby, but I thought it would be fun, so here we are.

If you want to use this, it's essentially a slightly modified version of the gatsby starter blog. Go ahead and use this, or use that. I left the blog post markdown plugins in, and the default blog posts, in case I decide to blog down the road.
